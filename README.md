## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
the biggest challenge was the fact i was limited by the amout of API calls i could make the place i got the API from limited me to 150 calls and it didnt help that i was still trying to understand the API and accidently made 100 call out of my 150 limit per a day :/ . also it was somewhat challenging to understand the API at first.
